A lightweight mod that adds more game rules to fine tune realm stability better.

AI Only : Change the realm stability for the AI, this will make it easier for the AI to keep hold of their realm and reduces rebellions.

Player Only : Change your own realm stability, to make the game easier. Chances of rebellions are reduced.

Chaos mode makes all factions more inclined to be created and revolt against their overlord.

Should be compatible with pretty much every mod on the workshop. Unless they change Faction Modifiers, which are some balance mods.
